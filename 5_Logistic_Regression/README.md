The next topic takes a look at a classification Model, known as logistic Regression, and gives a new intuition and Reasoning behind Gradient Descent. The theory has been separated into two notebooks for your comfort, and relevant exercise along with it. 

We recommend you go through the Logistic Regression Series, as covered by Andrew NG in his deep learning specialization. Although not math heavy it is one of the most revered courses in the Machine Learning Community. (The notation used by him is slightly different, and hence are the equations, but they have the same basic principles at heart)
